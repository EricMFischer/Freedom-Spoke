# Project Name

> Freedom Spoke is a unique flight platform that lets you search for multiple destinations at once and compare results from Google's API (which sources Expedia, Orbitz, etc.) to those from Skiplagged. Skiplagged is a hidden-city search engine that checks to see if a person's intended destination is a connecting city for some other cheaper flight.

> Freedom Spoke gives users maximum visibility into all flight prices. Check it out here: https://freedom-spoke.herokuapp.com/.
