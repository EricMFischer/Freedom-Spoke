# Freedom Spoke
Freedom Spoke is a flight platform that finds users the best prices for up to five destinations at once, drawing results from both Skiplagged and Google’s QPX flight API from ITA Software. As Google and Skiplagged alternate in finding the best prices, Freedom Spoke provides the value-add of consistently finding the best price. 

I built the app in AngularJS with Node.js and Express on the backend and utilized JWT to ensure secure user authentication. I also ran Python scripts and MySQL commands on CSV files in a CartoDB database to produce an interactive map of the world’s airports.
